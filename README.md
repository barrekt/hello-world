Intro to GitHub test to play with new branch and change requests

I'm not a dev, but using this example as a way of learning the proccesses involved with GitHub.

GitHub repo's use 'branches'. This is away of creating 'versions' of an element within a project to edit without impacting the 'main' branch (which is our production branch). 

By editing the readme-edits branch, I can then commmit (save) changes to the main (production) branch when I am happy with the changes.

I have made changes to this README.md file. 'committing' will save the file to this branch.
